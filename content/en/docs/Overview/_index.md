  What is COAsT?
---

COAsT (Coastal Ocean Assessment Toolkit) is a diagnostics and assessment python
toolbox for kilometric scale regional models. The aim is that this toolbox is
community-ready and flexible.

The initial focus will be on delivering a limited number of novel diagnostics
for [NEMO](https://www.nemo-ocean.eu) configurations, but that the toolbox would
be expanded to include other diagnostics and other ocean models.
